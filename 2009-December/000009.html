<PRE>To All Whom It May Concern

Z.C++ is now in stage two (test case coverage), although I may bundle 
some stage-3 work into this.

Full enumerator parsing had to be cut due to time constraints.  (Almost 
there in my local fork, but positively do not want to schedule the time 
to work around unsigned_fixed_int being a standard-layout class rather 
than a POD.).  I'm not comfortable about the gross holes in diagnosing 
One Definition Rule violations so that may &quot;weasel in&quot; under test 
cases.  Again: trying for Z.C++ 0.0.3 release in late Dec. 2009.

Newly implemented features:
* no-namespace restriction in C++ lifted.  We only try to handle C++98 
namespaces, and do not handle namespace aliases or using directives either.
* New options wired in: -Wc-c++-compat, -Wbackport
* the CLang preprocessor extension __has_include() was implemented.

Commentary below assumes only one developer:

The following testing features are still possible for Z.C++ 0.0.3
* tools subdirectory: Redundancy is good. The Python helper scripts for 
automatically forking the test cases can use replicas in other scripting 
languages.
* ISO mode: while it is unlikely that full ISO mode building will come 
up, changing the Zaimoni.STL build system to build both Win32-specific 
and ISO-mode libraries on MingW32 is feasible.

The following features will not make it in Z.C++ 0.0.3
* function declaration parsing.
** Source-code reductions for some easy cases. sizeof operator and 
strlen function on string literals come to mind, but a systematic review 
is in order.
* CLang has __has_builtin and __has_feature &quot;magic macros&quot;.
* Checking the incoming tokens to the INT.._C and UINT..._C macros in 
stdint.h/cstdint . (The standards requires a single unsuffixed integer 
literal token.) This would use a new ZCC pragma.
* Handle target CHAR_BIT!= host CHAR_BIT
* Cross-platform floating point arithmetic emulation (this is starting 
to look ugly, as comp.lang.fortran suggests there's quite a bit of 
hardware out there that isn't even remotely close to IEEE)

The following test case sets definitely will not make it into Z.C++ 0.0.3
* z_cpp: Random test driver for arithmetic.
* pseudorandom regression test driver framework (currently in research 
stage).

Feature creep is ruled out: the following are going to have to wait.
* starting work on: Fortran 66, Haskell 98, ALGOL68 support
* Build a catalog of exotic hardware features to handle.
* build in ISO mode (required for MSVC support)

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
