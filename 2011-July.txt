To All Whom It May Concern,

We have schedule slip.  Physically I could start the release process 
today (July 30 2011) and get it out tomorrow, but the implementation of 
the __zcc_linkage extension is incomplete: it does not handle global 
variables yet.

I'm going to let the release month slide to August 2011.  The current 
plan is:
* bring up actually registering global variables with the type_system 
object; finish setting up errors and cross-language warnings when doing 
this.  Do initial adjustments to __zcc_linkage implementation.  Go to 
stage 2 when this is done.
* roll out the test cases verifying pass/fail for what has been 
implemented.  Go to stage 3 when this is done
* Complete stage three activities (source code cleanup and 
microoptimizations), then spin the release of Z.C++ 0.0.9.

In particular, neither full function signature parsing, nor actually 
writing object files, are targeted for Z.C++ 0.0.9 .

Kenneth

P.S.  All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp or zcc -E, not documented 
as intentional, will block the release of Z.C++ 0.0.9.  Please report 
such bugs immediately to zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de .  Reduced test 
cases would be appreciated.
