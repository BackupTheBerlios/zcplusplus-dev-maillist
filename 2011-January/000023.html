</I>Correct.  I did the slow-moving target in the standards first.  The C 
and C++ preprocessors should be compliant, other than most of the 
standard library headers are not implemented and an intolerance for uses 
of # and ## operators that are doomed to error on macro instantiation.  
[That error is downgraded to a warning by --pedantic.]  Those headers 
that are implemented, should be compliant.

This preprocessor actively blocks attempts to #define keywords (indeed, 
anything that the standards say would cause undefined behavior).  It 
doesn't enforce reserved classes of identifiers yet (e.g., the 
reservation of identifiers ending in _t in POSIX), but that is planned.  
Likewise for verifying what's going into the INT_.._C and UINT_.._C 
macro families in stdint.h/cstdint (not enforced but scheduled).

limits.h/climits, stdint.h/cstdint, and stddef.h/cstddef are generated 
on-the-fly in response to the command-line options for target machine 
properties.  When proper floating point support goes in, the 
implementation specific headers for those are scheduled to be 
automatically generated as well.

iso646.h/ciso646 and stdbool.h/cstdbool are also available and working.  
#include &lt;typeinfo&gt; does nothing useful other than enable the extensions 
for compile-time evaluation of operator == and != for the typeid 
operator, and prevent erroring on the typeid operator.
&gt;<i> Am I right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the status of C/C++ semantic analysis?
</I>* Integer constant expressions should be evaluated at compile-time 
according to target arithmetic.  This is largely inherited from the C 
preprocessor's standard compliance.  (E.g., we will detect trapping 
representations.]  If no options are used to specify target integer 
representation, we assume Intel:
** 8-bit char; sizeof(short)==2, sizeof(int)==4, sizeof(long)==4, 
sizeof(long long)==8, char has same representation as unsigned char.
** non-trapping two's-complement representation
* sizeof operator will work on integral and enumeration types, and 
string literals.  The internal CPU model doesn't have the configuration 
for floating point yet.
* Z.C++ does not error on run-time issues in the ternary operator ? : 
for compile-time unevaluated expressions, as required by C99/C++0X.  
E.g., (1 ? 2 : 1/0) will not error or warn.
* enumeration support for C99/C++98 is as good as integer constant 
expression support.  We do catch values going out of bounds, and 
non-existence of base types in C++.  We do not handle the C++0X-specific 
syntax yet.
* static assertion support [C _Static_Assert, C++ static_assert ] is as 
good as enumeration and integer constant expression support.
* C++'s typeid operator is very minimally supported (we have an 
extension to allow evaluating == and != at compile time to test the type 
system).  More substantial uses actually requiring the class definition 
will fail.
* typedefs are parsed as well as the rest of the type system parsing.
* We have enough namespace support in C++ to typedef std::size_t , and 
do basic declarations within namespaces.  Namespace aliases and C++0X 
inline namespaces aren't implemented yet.

Anything not mentioned above, should be assumed to be substantially missing.
* Z.C++ 0.0.7 *recognizes* that a non-template class, struct, or union 
has been defined fine, will allow declaring global variables using these 
types, and will catch multiple definition errors, but will not parse the 
inside of the definition worth anything.  The test case suite scheduled 
to go in next, is to verify that things behave reasonably here.
* We do try to notice problems with duplicate storage classes (typedef, 
extern, static, ...) on global variables.  We aren't clever enough to 
try to guess C++0X vs. C++03 or earlier, and assume auto is a type 
rather than a storage class as in C.
* Functions are not recognized at all (which forces pre-alpha status), 
and blocks most of the standard headers pretty much completely.  
Likewise for templates.  Most of the invisible work in preparing for 
Z.C++ 0.0.7 was improving the parser to be refactorable for this.
* Compile-time target-emulated floating point arithmetic hasn't been 
implemented either.  Parsing of these expressions is not heavily tested, 
but the infrastructure is intended to be there.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have working on windows + mingw.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still have now idea how to build this compiler, any document or 
</I>&gt;<i> instructions?
</I>The build instructions on the home page <A HREF="http://zcplusplus.berlios.de/">http://zcplusplus.berlios.de/</A> 
need a rewrite for clarity, then.

Until the build system situation is fixed, you'll need to be on 
Windows/MingW (with GNU make).  It should suffice to use either a source 
release tarball or an SVN checkout.  Known-good versions of MingW are 
3.4.x and 4.3.x.  4.2.x *almost* works (it'll pass the test suites, but 
not work so well if you want the built-in help interactively).  4.4.x 
and 4.5.x are both known to fail when building the Windows-specific C 
memory manager, by generating illegal assembly as an intermediate 
stage.  Fixing this is relatively low priority, as these versions also 
fail to compile libjpeg and libpng the same way.

The build is in-source.  After making sure the Boost headers are 
installed in a system directory, adjust the POSIX.inc files to control 
compiler options. (defaults should give you a debug build), then invoke 
GNU make with no parameters. from the top-level source directory [the 
one containing the Zaimoni.STL directory and CSupport.cpp]  (I do so 
from the cmd.exe shell, with a locally built make 3.8.1 .)

To get the absolute paths to the Z.C++ system headers to work, you'll 
want to adjust the INSTALL_TO macro in CPreproc.cpp .  [This may need 
relocating to _version.h .]
