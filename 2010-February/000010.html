<PRE>To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ is now in stage one (new features).

Implemented features:
* enumerator initializer parsing (as far as the expression parser in 
general goes)
* erroring on of definition of typedefs and enums with the same name.

Assuming only one developer, the highest-priority changes currently are:
* Reduce the z_cpp executable size by restricting the binary to what is 
needed for preprocessing.
* use enumerators in expression parsing.

The following testing features are still possible for Z.C++ 0.0.4
* tools subdirectory: Redundancy is good. The Python helper scripts for 
automatically forking the test cases can use replicas in other scripting 
languages.
* ISO mode: while it is unlikely that full ISO mode building will come 
up, changing the Zaimoni.STL build system to build both Win32-specific 
and ISO-mode libraries on MingW32 is feasible.
* handling sizeof(char), sizeof(unsigned char), sizeof(signed char).

The following features will not make it in Z.C++ 0.0.4
* function declaration parsing.
** Source-code reductions for some easy cases. sizeof operator and 
strlen function on string literals come to mind, but a systematic review 
is in order.
* CLang has __has_builtin and __has_feature &quot;magic macros&quot;.
* Checking the incoming tokens to the INT.._C and UINT..._C macros in 
stdint.h/cstdint . (The standards requires a single unsuffixed integer 
literal token.) This would use a new ZCC pragma.
* Handle target CHAR_BIT!= host CHAR_BIT
* Cross-platform floating point arithmetic emulation (comp.lang.fortran suggests there's quite a bit of 
hardware out there that isn't even remotely close to IEEE)

The following test case sets definitely will not make it into Z.C++ 0.0.3
* z_cpp: Random test driver for arithmetic.
* pseudorandom regression test driver framework (currently in research 
stage).

Feature creep is ruled out: the following are going to have to wait.
* starting work on: Fortran 66, Haskell 98, ALGOL68 support
* Build a catalog of exotic hardware features to handle.
* build in ISO mode (required for MSVC support)

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional, 
will be considered blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2 
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.4).  Please report such bugs 
immediately to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/zcplusplus-dev">zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de</A> .  Reduced test cases
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
