<PRE>To All Whom It May Concern,

Z.C++ remains in stage one.  The release schedule has critically 
slipped; test case coverage for the primary new feature (using 
enumerators in expression parsing) is not complete enough to proceed to 
stage 2.  Release is retargeted for the end of April 2010.

The other features being considered for stage 1 are
* minimal recognition of asm( ) directives

* handling sizeof(char), sizeof(unsigned char), sizeof(signed char).  Optimization would be to 1U (or whatever the target size_t wants).

Reducing the z_cpp executable size has been implemented.

The following features will not make it in Z.C++ 0.0.4
* tools subdirectory: Redundancy is good. The Python helper scripts for
automatically forking the test cases can use replicas in other scripting
languages.
* ISO mode: while it is unlikely that full ISO mode building will come
up, changing the Zaimoni.STL build system to build both Win32-specific
and ISO-mode libraries on MingW32 is feasible.
* function declaration parsing.
** Source-code reductions for some easy cases. sizeof operator and
strlen function on string literals come to mind, but a systematic review
is in order.
* CLang has __has_builtin and __has_feature &quot;magic macros&quot;.
* Checking the incoming tokens to the INT.._C and UINT..._C macros in
stdint.h/cstdint . (The standards requires a single unsuffixed integer
literal token.) This would use a new ZCC pragma.
* Handle target CHAR_BIT!= host CHAR_BIT
* Cross-platform floating point arithmetic emulation (comp.lang.fortran suggests there's quite a bit of
hardware out there that isn't even remotely close to IEEE)

The following test case sets definitely will not make it into Z.C++ 0.0.4
* z_cpp: Random test driver for arithmetic.
* pseudorandom regression test driver framework (currently in research
stage).

Feature creep is ruled out: the following are going to have to wait.
* starting work on: Fortran 66, Haskell 98, ALGOL68 support
* Build a catalog of exotic hardware features to handle.
* build in ISO mode (required for MSVC support)

All C99/C++0X compliance errors in z_cpp, not documented as intentional,
will be considered blocking transition from stage 1 to stage 2
(effectively blocking release of Z.C++ 0.0.4).  Please report such bugs
immediately to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/zcplusplus-dev">zcplusplus-dev at lists.berlios.de</A> .  Reduced test cases
would be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Kenneth Boyd
